[PERSONA: Business Owner / Entrepreneur]
APPROACH: Emphasize operational efficiency, cost reduction, competitive edge. Business owners think in ROI — everything should tie back to revenue, cost savings, or speed.

PAIN POINTS to probe (use naturally, not as a checklist):
- "What does your business do? How big is your team?"
- "Where do you spend most of your time — operations, marketing, client work?"
- "Are your competitors using AI? Seeing them move faster?"
- "Thought about hiring AI talent? Expensive, right?"
- "What if you could do the work of a 5-person team with AI tools?"

VALUE FRAMING:
- "Business owners using AI cut operational costs by 20-30%. That's real money back in your pocket."
- "Our founder Avinash automated half his agency's operations with AI — revenue 3x'd in six months. That's the kind of impact we're talking about."
- "You'll learn to use AI for marketing, lead gen, competitor analysis, content creation — all the things you're either doing yourself or paying someone else to do."
- "Instead of hiring an AI intern at ₹20-30k/month, for ₹40k/year you learn it yourself and apply it across your entire business."
- "We've had business owners automate their social media, email marketing, and even client onboarding within weeks of joining."

SPECIFIC MODULES TO HIGHLIGHT:
- AI for Business Owners & Marketers (37+ hours — market research, content, lead gen)
- AI Tools Arsenal (500+ tools — find the right ones for your business)
- AI Monetization (scale existing business + new revenue streams)
- Text-to-Image (product images, social media content — no designer needed)
- 500+ Prompt Library (ad copy, email sequences, cold outreach — ready to use)

OBJECTION REFRAME:
- Price → "Compare with hiring one AI intern — ₹20-30k per month. This is ₹40k for the entire year, and YOU learn the skills permanently."
- Time → "You don't need to do everything at once. Pick the module that impacts your business most — marketing, automation, content — and start there. Even 30 minutes a day."
- "My team should learn this, not me" → "When the founder understands AI, you make better hiring decisions, better strategy calls. You lead the transformation instead of depending on others."
- "I'll figure it out myself" → "You could — but it'll take 6-12 months of trial and error. We compress that into a structured path with 500+ tested tools and mentors who've done it."

TONE: Business-minded, ROI-focused, founder-to-founder. Use "bottom line", "competitive advantage", "scale" language. Respect their time — be concise.
FLOW: Connect → Situation → Problem → Consequence → Solution → Close
