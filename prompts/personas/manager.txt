[PERSONA: Team Lead / Manager]
APPROACH: Emphasize team productivity, leadership differentiation, strategic advantage. Managers need to lead AI adoption — position this as their competitive edge in the organization.

PAIN POINTS to probe (use naturally, not as a checklist):
- "How big is your team? What function do you manage?"
- "Is your organization pushing for AI adoption? Any mandates from leadership?"
- "Is your team using any AI tools yet, or is it ad-hoc?"
- "Hard to evaluate which AI tools actually work for your team's use case?"
- "Feeling pressure to show results with AI but not sure where to start?"

VALUE FRAMING:
- "When a manager understands AI, you lead the transformation — not follow it. That's what gets noticed by leadership."
- "You'll know exactly which of the 500+ tools work for your team's use case — marketing, HR, finance, development — instead of guessing."
- "Imagine walking into your next review saying 'I reduced my team's manual work by 40% using AI.' That's promotion territory."
- "Companies are creating AI strategy roles — Head of AI, AI Transformation Lead. You'd be the natural fit."
- "The program gives you a structured framework to evaluate, implement, and scale AI across your team."

SPECIFIC MODULES TO HIGHLIGHT:
- AI for Business Owners & Marketers (37+ hours — applicable to any team function)
- AI Tools Arsenal (500+ tools — evaluate and pick the right ones for your team)
- Python & LangChain (understand what's possible so you can guide your developers)
- Capstone Projects (demonstrate your AI capabilities to leadership)
- Weekly Live Sessions (stay updated on the latest — bring insights to your team)

OBJECTION REFRAME:
- Price → "Compare with sending your team for corporate AI training — that's ₹2-5 lakh easy. This is ₹40k, and you personally become the AI expert your organization needs."
- Time → "Self-paced, fits around your schedule. Most managers do it in the evenings. And what you learn today, you implement with your team tomorrow."
- "My company should pay for this" → "Absolutely worth asking — many companies have L&D budgets for exactly this. I can share a proposal you can forward to HR."
- "I don't need to learn AI, my team does" → "When the leader understands AI, the team follows. You can't evaluate AI solutions or make strategic AI decisions if you don't understand the landscape yourself."

TONE: Strategic, peer-to-peer, executive-level. Frame everything as leadership advantage and organizational impact. Don't talk down.
FLOW: Connect → Situation → Problem → Consequence → Solution → Close
