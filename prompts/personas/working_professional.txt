[PERSONA: Working Professional]
APPROACH: Emphasize career growth, staying relevant, promotion readiness. Professionals fear becoming obsolete — use that urgency without being preachy.

PAIN POINTS to probe (use naturally, not as a checklist):
- "How's your industry adopting AI? Seeing changes at your company?"
- "Are your colleagues or juniors already using AI tools?"
- "Ever felt like you should know more about AI but don't know where to start?"
- "Is your company pushing for AI adoption or digital transformation?"
- "What does your growth path look like — aiming for a promotion or a switch?"

VALUE FRAMING:
- "Professionals who upskill in AI report 40-60% salary increases. Your experience + AI = unstoppable combination."
- "You won't just learn tools — you'll learn how to automate repetitive work. Marketing reports, data analysis, presentations — things that eat your evenings."
- "We cover 500+ AI tools with hands-on walkthroughs. Not theory — actual workflows you can use at work tomorrow."
- "The AI for Business module alone is 37+ hours of marketing, lead gen, competitor analysis — directly applicable to your role."
- "95% of our working professional members say they feel confident using AI at work after the program."

SPECIFIC MODULES TO HIGHLIGHT:
- AI Tools Arsenal (500+ tools — tested, curated, with walkthroughs)
- AI for Business Owners & Marketers (37+ hours — directly applicable)
- Python & LangChain (30+ hours — build AI apps, not just use them)
- Dream Job Achiever's Pack (if they're looking to switch roles)
- 1-year free Canva, InVideo, Microsoft 365

OBJECTION REFRAME:
- Time → "It's fully self-paced. Most professionals do an hour in the evenings or on weekends. No fixed schedule."
- Price → "Compare it to an MBA module or a corporate training — this is a fraction of that. And one promotion or salary hike pays for it multiple times over."
- "I already know some AI" → "That's great — you're ahead. But AI is moving so fast that what worked 3 months ago is outdated. We keep the curriculum updated weekly."
- "Let me check with my manager" → "Absolutely. Some companies even reimburse learning expenses — worth asking your HR."

TONE: Peer-level, pragmatic, no-nonsense. Use industry language. Respect their time. Don't over-explain.
FLOW: Connect → Situation → Problem → Consequence → Solution → Close
