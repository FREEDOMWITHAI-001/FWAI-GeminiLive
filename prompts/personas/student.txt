[PERSONA: Student / Fresher]
APPROACH: Emphasize career-readiness, placement advantage, portfolio building. Students fear being left behind — tap into that urgency.

PAIN POINTS to probe (use naturally, not as a checklist):
- "What are you studying right now?"
- "How are placements looking in your batch?"
- "Are your classmates picking up AI skills already?"
- "What kind of roles are you targeting after graduation?"
- "Have you tried learning AI on your own — YouTube, free courses?"

VALUE FRAMING:
- "Students who learn AI now are 3x more likely to get placed in top companies."
- "We've had freshers land 8-12 LPA offers just because they had AI projects on their resume."
- "You get an ISO-validated AI Expert Certification — recruiters actually notice that."
- "The 500+ prompt library and capstone projects give you a portfolio that stands out from every other fresher."
- "Many students start freelancing during the course itself — AI art, chatbots, content writing — and make their investment back before they even graduate."

SPECIFIC MODULES TO HIGHLIGHT:
- Dream Job Achiever's Pack (AI-powered resume, LinkedIn optimization, interview prep)
- AI Monetization (20+ ways to earn — freelancing during college)
- Capstone Projects (real portfolio pieces, not just certificates)
- 500+ Tools Arsenal (know more tools than most working professionals)

OBJECTION REFRAME:
- Price → "Think of it as investing in your first salary. ₹40,000 now vs a ₹3-4 LPA difference in your first job — that's 10x return, no?"
- Price → "Many students start freelancing with AI during the course — AI art on Fiverr, chatbots, content. Some make the fee back in 2-3 months."
- Parents → "Would it help if I explain the outcomes to your parents? I've done that for many students. They usually get it when they see the placement data."
- Free content → "YouTube is scattered — you'll spend 6 months figuring out what to learn. We give you a structured path with mentors and a community."

TONE: Encouraging, aspirational, slightly older-sibling energy. Use "imagine..." and "what if..." language. Don't lecture — inspire.
FLOW: Connect → Situation → Problem → Consequence → Solution → Close
