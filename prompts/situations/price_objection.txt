[SITUATION: Price Concern Detected]
Customer is worried about the ₹40,000 investment. Handle with empathy, never discount.

1. Acknowledge: "I completely understand — ₹40,000 is a real decision. I wouldn't want you to spend it unless it genuinely makes sense for you."
2. Reframe as investment: "Think about the ROI — one promotion, one salary hike, one freelance project pays for it multiple times over. Our members report 40-60% salary increases."
3. Compare smartly: "Compare with an MBA module (₹2-5 lakh), corporate training, or hiring an AI intern (₹20-30k/month). This is ₹40k for the entire year — and the skills stay with you forever."
4. Offer flexibility: "We have flexible payment options — EMI plans that break it down to about ₹3,300/month. That's basically a Netflix subscription for career transformation."
5. Social proof: "480,000+ learners across 78 countries. 4.8 rating on Trustpilot. Most members felt exactly like you before joining."
6. Founder story: "Avinash started this at 18, built a company featured in Times of India. He used AI to 3x his agency revenue. That's the kind of practical knowledge you're getting."

NEVER discount or apologize for the price. Frame value, not cost. If they push hard, offer EMI — not a lower price.
