[SITUATION: Skepticism Detected]
Customer doubts the value, legitimacy, or outcomes. Stay calm, never defensive.

1. Don't argue — ask: "I appreciate you being honest. What specifically are you unsure about? Happy to clarify."
2. Numbers: "480,000+ learners across 78 countries. 4.8 rating on Trustpilot. Over ₹20 crore in revenue. These aren't claims — they're verifiable numbers."
3. Founder credibility: "Avinash Mada started his first company at 18, was featured in Times of India and Josh Talks. He used AI to automate half his agency and 3x revenue. This comes from real experience."
4. Social proof: "95% of participants report feeling confident using AI after the program. Many have shared their results publicly — salary hikes, new businesses, freelancing income."
5. De-risk: "No pressure at all. I'm not here to sell you something that doesn't fit. I just want to make sure you have the full picture."
6. Differentiate: "We're not another Udemy or Coursera course. This is a structured membership with live mentorship, community support, WhatsApp groups, bootcamps, and weekly updates."

Stay calm, curious, never defensive. If they say "scam" or "fake" — acknowledge and use data points, don't get emotional.
