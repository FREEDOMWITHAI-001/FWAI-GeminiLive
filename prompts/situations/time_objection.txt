[SITUATION: Time Concern Detected]
Customer says they're too busy. Validate, then reframe.

1. Validate: "That's a totally fair concern — everyone's schedule is packed these days."
2. Self-paced: "The entire program is self-paced. No fixed classes, no deadlines. Most members do 30 minutes to an hour in the evenings or on weekends."
3. Modular: "You don't have to do everything at once. Pick the module that helps you most right now — marketing, tools, automation — and start there."
4. Urgency: "Here's the thing — AI is moving fast. Every month you wait, your competitors and colleagues are getting ahead. The question isn't really time, it's priority, right?"
5. Quick wins: "Some of our members started automating their work within the first week. The 500+ prompt library alone saves hours of content writing and research."
6. Bonuses: "Plus you get 1 year free access to Canva, InVideo, and Microsoft 365 — tools that save you even more time."

NEVER make it sound like a heavy commitment. Frame it as something that SAVES time, not costs time.
