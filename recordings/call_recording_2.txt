00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,120 [Speaker 0]
Hello. 

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,760 [Speaker 1]
Hello? 

00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,800 [Speaker 0]
Uh, hi, Pawan. Really sorry. 

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,159 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. That's all right. 

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:25,300 [Speaker 0]
Cool. So, uh, as I told you that, uh, see, there are a number of AI tools which you can use actually in any particular domain. So for you, in financial planning and analysis, there are a few tools such as Data Rails, Pigment, uh, Planful. Like Planful is a AI tool, uh, AI-powered planning and forecasting, integrates ERP, CRMs, and Excel. So there's something called Cube- 

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,680 [Speaker 1]
Tell me, which is Data Railing, huh? 

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,880 [Speaker 0]
Data Rail, Data Rails. It's a end-to-end FP&A automation, like- 

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,660 [Speaker 1]
Railings. R-A-I-L-E-S, is it? 

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,640 [Speaker 0]
R-A-I-L-S, Rails. 

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,510 [Speaker 1]
R-A-I-L-S. Okay, Data Rails, then Pigment. 

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,180 [Speaker 0]
Uh, Pigment, uh, Planful. 

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,020 [Speaker 1]
Plan? 

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,900 [Speaker 0]
Planful, Planful. P-L-A-N-F-U-L. 

00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,520 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,560 [Speaker 0]
Cube Software. Like, I'll be sharing you the list, like, if you want to join with. 

00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,140 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah, yeah. 

00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:02,580 [Speaker 0]
So this list of these tools, like, you can get it from anywhere, actually. Like, even if you go to any AI tool and give it a proper prompt, like, you just give it, uh, the 

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,720 [Speaker 0]
description of your work profile- 

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:04,730 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,070 [Speaker 0]
... stating that, um, how you can utilize AI tools, it's gonna give you a few AI tools, like the list of these AI tools. 

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,100 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,240 [Speaker 0]
Getting the list is not a, uh, big thing, but utilizing the AI tools, it matters, right? 

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:26,920 [Speaker 1]
No, no, I understand. I'm just asking because will I get to learn all these, uh, how to use these AI tools in your classes? 

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,440 [Speaker 0]
Yes, we do. Uh, so that's what prompt engineering is, actually. 

00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,400 [Speaker 1]
Prompt. How to get the details from these, uh, tools, right? 

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,410 [Speaker 0]
Yes. How to utilize these AI tools in the best way possible. 

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:38,420 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,380 [Speaker 0]
Not only these AI tools, but any AI tool in any domain. 

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,700 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Any AI tool, any domain. Okay. 

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,420 [Speaker 0]
In any domain. 

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,500 [Speaker 1]
So- 

00:01:46,500 --> 00:02:00,240 [Speaker 0]
Like, let's assume if you are a lawyer, you can use these AI tools for this, uh, previous case studies of these particular cases, as well as if... Let's assume if you are a medical representative, you can utilize the AI tools to understand the patient's previous history. 

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,750 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,330 [Speaker 0]
So with these kind of AI tools, there are a number of AI tools in every domain. 

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:04,340 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,669 [Speaker 0]
To utilize these AI tools, prompt is, prompting eng-- is important, and that's what we'll be teaching you. So basically- 

00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,800 [Speaker 1]
You will teach us. How many days class is this? 

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,000 [Speaker 0]
So it actually depends upon the time which you are actually investing on the course. So the subscription of our course is for one year. 

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100 [Speaker 1]
Oh, okay, only one year. 

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,680 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, subscription is for one year, but the duration- 

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,690 [Speaker 1]
Okay 

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,280 [Speaker 0]
... it depends upon the time. Let's as, let's assume if you're investing two to three hours of your time every day- 

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,680 [Speaker 1]
Uh. 

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,540 [Speaker 0]
-you can just complete the course within one twen-- maximum one twenty days, including the projects. 

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,260 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,420 [Speaker 0]
And, uh, so the- 

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,100 [Speaker 1]
What projects will you have? 

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:57,560 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, so there will be six, uh, technical and six non-technical projects, like developing this kind of, uh, tools with AI, or else like automating things, data visualization part. Like, we do have similar... Like, each person will be getting other, other projects, uh, 

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,600 [Speaker 0]
Pawan. Like, I really can't say which, uh, exactly which project, which you'll be getting. 

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,740 [Speaker 1]
Hmm. 

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,200 [Speaker 0]
So each person, depending upon their perspective, you'll be getting different projects. 

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,960 [Speaker 1]
How many projects you will be- 

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,560 [Speaker 0]
Uh, so as you are not a technical guy, you'll be having- 

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,570 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,500 [Speaker 0]
... six non-technical projects. 

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,900 [Speaker 1]
Six non-technical? 

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,840 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760 [Speaker 1]
Projects. Okay. 

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:19,880 [Speaker 0]
So- 

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,100 [Speaker 1]
With that, uh... Yeah, tell me. 

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,740 [Speaker 0]
No, no, no. Yeah. Yes, please go on. Ask your queries. 

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,700 [Speaker 1]
No, no. Uh, yeah, go on, go on, go on. So after this, what happens? 

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:38,320 [Speaker 0]
Post-completion of your project, you'll be getting an ISO individual certificate, like, which is the highest value certificate in the job market. 

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,740 [Speaker 1]
ISO what certificate? 

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,560 [Speaker 0]
ISO individual. Individual certificate. 

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,980 [Speaker 1]
Individual certificate. 

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,020 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,460 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,720 [Speaker 0]
So- 

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,020 [Speaker 1]
That's given by whom? 

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,100 [Speaker 0]
Uh, Sridham IT. 

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,299 [Speaker 1]
That's your, your own certification? 

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,560 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. So, like, we are ISO-integrated company, right? 

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,660 [Speaker 1]
Uh-huh. 

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:07,490 [Speaker 0]
So you'll be getting this certification. And, uh, see, let's assume if you are using AI to-- You can also use AI to make some passive income, too, right? Like the content creation part, which Avinash mentioned. So- 

00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,490 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,620 [Speaker 0]
... as you told me that you don't have any prior knowledge about this, uh, coding thing, right? 

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:12,880 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,370 [Speaker 0]
The AI itself is non-coding part. 

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,420 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,920 [Speaker 0]
As I told you, there are two types of prompt engineers. One is a non-technical prompt engineer, other is a technical prompt engineer. 

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:32,300 [Speaker 1]
What is the scope for this non-technical prompt engineer in the market for, uh... I mean, actually, I'm, uh, seventeen years experience I'm having. 

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,620 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,260 [Speaker 1]
So, uh, yeah, what is the scope for this 

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,540 [Speaker 1]
for me? 

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:54,660 [Speaker 0]
So, uh, let's talk, uh... See, as you already hold seventeen years of experience, I would highly recommend you not to, uh, switch your job at the moment, because you might be getting packages which are, uh, meant for freshers, like seven or most probably eight to ten LPA- 

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,700 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,360 [Speaker 0]
... is the starting fresher salary which prompt engineers would get. 

00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,900 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:11,140 [Speaker 0]
So basically, non-tech guys, non-technical prompt engineers are those, like, who utilize AI tools to create apps, websites, custom chatbots, or other tools. 

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,240 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,340 [Speaker 0]
So technical prompt engineers are those who create AI tools. 

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,020 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,160 [Speaker 0]
So- 

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,100 [Speaker 1]
Non-technical, what is, what, what is the, what is the role, non-technical? Can you please tell again? 

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:31,500 [Speaker 0]
Non-technical guys are those who create, uh, uh, websites or scalable apps, or, uh, custom chatbots or voicebots, or develop any- 

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,580 [Speaker 1]
Chatbots? 

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,660 [Speaker 0]
Chatbots, yes. 

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,300 [Speaker 1]
Developing chatbots? 

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,099 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, developing chatbots, voicebots, websites- 

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,469 [Speaker 1]
Uh. 

00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:41,580 [Speaker 0]
-uh, 

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,620 [Speaker 0]
apps, mobile applications. 

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,039 [Speaker 1]
Uh, even mobile applications, is it? 

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,270 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,900 [Speaker 0]
There's something called build.new, which, uh, you can use, uh, and you can create a website, and you can deploy it on Play Store or App Store. 

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,060 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,420 [Speaker 0]
So 

00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,780 [Speaker 0]
non-tech guys, what other- 

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,960 [Speaker 1]
What other, uh-... what are the will, roles will, uh, non-technical guys have? 

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,360 [Speaker 0]
See, AI trainer, AI business analyst, AI manager, AI consultant. 

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,400 [Speaker 1]
No, no, no. Uh, the activities, like what you said, developing chatbots, websites, mobile apps. 

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,120 [Speaker 0]
Voice bots. So anything like, uh... See, developing anything using AI tool. 

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,720 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,000 [Speaker 0]
Is an, uh, work of non-technical prompt engineer. Developing AI tool is a work of technical prompt engineer. 

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080 [Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Use- By using AI, whatever we can, we can develop? 

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,120 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,480 [Speaker 1]
Ah, okay. Non-technical guys, okay. 

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,500 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,620 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,930 [Speaker 0]
And that's what we'll be teaching you, so that you can utilize any AI tool in any domain to create anything. 

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,840 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,770 [Speaker 0]
So you, uh, see, nowadays- 

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,760 [Speaker 1]
Now, you're telling the scope for this is, uh, seven to ten lakhs, right? 

00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,120 [Speaker 0]
For the fresher. 

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,600 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, fresher. So for me, if I go, will I be a f- Will they treat me as a fresher or a experienced? 

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,790 [Speaker 0]
Uh, so, uh, like if you... That's what I told you, right? Like, if you completely shift your domain- 

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,810 [Speaker 1]
Ah. 

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,310 [Speaker 0]
-like, you would be treated as a fresher itself. 

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,820 [Speaker 1]
Ah. 

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,920 [Speaker 0]
I would highly recommend you to not to completely shift your domain- 

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:16,930 [Speaker 1]
Ah. 

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:27,820 [Speaker 0]
-but you can do one thing. You can integrate AI in your work, which is gonna give you, uh, scope on completing your work as soon as possible, like, uh, automate your work, and then- 

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:27,830 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:34,040 [Speaker 0]
... you, you will be getting some free time, wherein you can use it to create some side hustle. 

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,340 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, side hustle, right? 

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,820 [Speaker 0]
Yes. It's like passive income. 

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:37,840 [Speaker 1]
Ah. 

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,990 [Speaker 0]
See, most of the people are not only aligned with one job, right? 

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,000 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,720 [Speaker 0]
Like, they will be doing freelancing or other things to earn more money. 

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,330 [Speaker 1]
Ah. 

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,820 [Speaker 0]
And we'll be teaching you how to do this freelancing stuff, too, in the AI monetization module. 

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,860 [Speaker 1]
Okay. AI monetization mod- 

00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:03,840 [Speaker 0]
Like, uh, so, uh, achha, you're not clear with the things which we... So do you actually know what exactly we'll be teaching you in Freedom with AI? 

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:18,070 [Speaker 1]
No, uh, see, I seriously don't know what you're going to do, teach us. Uh, but, uh, what I, uh, know is that you will be giving access to all the, uh, you know, materials, what needs to be learned, self-study. 

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,120 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,750 [Speaker 1]
And, uh, yeah, I know that you will be having two classes where you can clear all the doubts. That's what I know. 

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,760 [Speaker 0]
So for doubt clarification, you'll be having your community managers, actually. And- 

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,980 [Speaker 1]
Uh, sorry, communities? 

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,140 [Speaker 0]
Community managers. You can just ping them- 

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,720 [Speaker 1]
Okay 

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,770 [Speaker 0]
... and your doubts will be clarified. 

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:34,799 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,640 [Speaker 0]
So live classes- 

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:35,700 [Speaker 1]
Okay 

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,640 [Speaker 0]
... are different. Like, you'll be having Q&A session in the live classes, too, but live classes something different- 

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:41,789 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,390 [Speaker 0]
... when compared to this pre-recorded content. 

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,420 [Speaker 1]
Mm.

Okay. Ah. 

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,000 [Speaker 0]

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,040 [Speaker 1]
