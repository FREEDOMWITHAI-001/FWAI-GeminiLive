00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,400 [Speaker 0]
Hello. Hi, Pawan Kumar. 

00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,239 [Speaker 1]
Yeah? 

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,580 [Speaker 0]
Pawan Kumar, this is Sameer. I'm calling you from Freedom with AI. 

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,020 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell me, Sameer. 

00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,080 [Speaker 0]
Cool. Uh, so is this a good time to talk? 

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,240 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. 

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,059 [Speaker 0]
Good. So Pawan, I believe that you have recently attended the AI master class with- 

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,230 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,620 [Speaker 0]
-Agara. 

00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,660 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,800 [Speaker 0]
So I just want to understand that, why did you register for this master class, Pawan? 

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,620 [Speaker 1]
Uh, one second. 

00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,980 [Speaker 0]
One second. 

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:41,620 [Speaker 1]
Two minutes. I'll just stop it. 

00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,080 [Speaker 1]
Hello? Hello. Yeah. 

00:00:46,080 --> 00:01:01,160 [Speaker 0]
So, uh, I understand that, uh, the AI and, uh, uh, machine learning and, uh, it is, you know, generative AI, whatever you're calling, all the AI- 

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,170 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:15,240 [Speaker 0]
-is generally being used in all the companies to reduce, uh, manual effort, and, uh, they're able to, you know, do most of the works what we are, uh... what, uh, we humans are able to do. 

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,360 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,360 [Speaker 0]
So, uh, yeah, like, in case we want to, um, communicate with them, 

00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,740 [Speaker 0]
so, uh, it would be good if we know- 

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,190 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,030 [Speaker 0]
... a good, uh, way, better way. 

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,070 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,490 [Speaker 0]
So that's why I wanted to, uh, register. I, uh, I, I joined this, uh, class. 

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,620 [Speaker 1]
So- -utilize AI tools in the best way possible, uh, to understand how to use AI, right? 

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,960 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Correct. 

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,420 [Speaker 1]
Got it. So where did you find out about this master class, Pawan? 

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,590 [Speaker 0]
Uh, online. 

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,600 [Speaker 1]
Online. 

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,160 [Speaker 1]
What attracted you the most from the session? 

00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,320 [Speaker 0]
No, this I've ne-- uh, never attended any such class, so I actually, 

00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,300 [Speaker 0]
uh, uh, wanted to see 

00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,660 [Speaker 0]
what is happening, and, uh, uh, that's why I attended. 

00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,620 [Speaker 1]
Got it. Got it. Like, is there any specific thing, like- -you felt that, okay, this thing is something good, or else- 

00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,720 [Speaker 0]
Right. Yeah, yeah 

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,380 [Speaker 1]
... uh, this kind of tools suited- 

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,450 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,780 [Speaker 1]
... any tool or any specific scenario attracted you in the master class? 

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:31,260 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Actually, I saw a couple of scenarios which, like, one is the podcast, what, uh, he showed, how, uh, a male and female voice could, uh, you know, uh, take up the conversation- 

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,660 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:42,260 [Speaker 0]
... uh, for a story. And also, mm, which is it? Uh, that was the main thing which I felt was like, wow, uh, mostly. 

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:50,100 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Got it. Got it. So Pawan, the reason I'm asking you these questions is to understand more about your profile. 

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,400 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,100 [Speaker 1]
And to see, like- 

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,609 [Speaker 0]
Correct. 

00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:52,320 [Speaker 1]
-the people... 

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,860 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Yeah, see, um, I don't have technical background, firstly. 

00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,300 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,920 [Speaker 0]
Uh, I'm an, uh... I'm a finance guy. 

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,800 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:10,100 [Speaker 0]
So I don't have any clue on, uh, Python or, uh, any such, uh, programming language- 

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,360 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:20,060 [Speaker 0]
... uh, that is required for this. Mainly, I wanted to see non-programming part, bit, uh, in AI. 

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,460 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:31,860 [Speaker 0]
So yeah. So one was this, uh, I think a prompt engineering. I don't know if, uh, only the, uh, techni-technical guys would be using it, or- 

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,109 [Speaker 1]
I don't know 

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,480 [Speaker 0]
-I don't know if I have scope in my area. 

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,650 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,860 [Speaker 0]
So, yeah. 

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,620 [Speaker 1]
So basically, prompt engineering is a way that you communicate with the AI tool to get the best out of it, okay? 

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:43,800 [Speaker 0]
Correct. 

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,650 [Speaker 1]
So it's, uh, it's not related to one particular domain. 

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:47,680 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:58,220 [Speaker 1]
Like, you can use prompting in any particular domain. Like recently, we do have this, uh, AI tools in, uh, healthcare, also in the judiciary and everything, right? 

00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,960 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,480 [Speaker 1]
Everywhere we do have this particular AI tools, but it's the way that you use it, right? 

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,740 [Speaker 0]
Correct. 

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,160 [Speaker 1]
Where are you using it is important. 

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,060 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:16,320 [Speaker 1]
So some, uh, there are a few technical tools, but what exactly Freedom with AI teaches you is non-technical prompt engineering. 

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,269 [Speaker 0]
Non-technical prompt engineering. 

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,380 [Speaker 1]
Non-technical. 

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,140 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,700 [Speaker 1]
So- 

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,500 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, okay. 

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,880 [Speaker 1]
And, uh- 

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,580 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,460 [Speaker 0]
And I saw that, uh, mostly the course that you have, it's self-study. 

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,740 [Speaker 1]
Uh, it's self-study as, as well as you'll be having two live classes. 

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,020 [Speaker 0]
Two live class. That is, uh, question and answer quest- uh, session, right? 

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,820 [Speaker 1]
No, no, no. It's two live classes. 

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,500 [Speaker 0]
Live classes? So what are they going to cover in that? 

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,910 [Speaker 1]
So, uh, one would be technical thing, which is, uh, Python and other stuff, and the other thing- 

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:49,920 [Speaker 0]
Mm 

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,760 [Speaker 1]
... would be non-technical, wherein, like, you'll be getting things about the marketing thing and other stuff. 

00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,700 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,539 [Speaker 1]
So how you can use AI for the marketing part and all that things. 

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:17,660 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Because, uh, self-study, I thought I wanted to attend, uh, live, live classes. I thought it would be better, uh, to understand it better. That was one thing which I was, uh, going in my mind. 

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,000 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, sorry. I understand your perspective, but the reason- 

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,010 [Speaker 0]
Mm 

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,020 [Speaker 1]
... why our classes is not live is: see, like- 

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,120 [Speaker 0]
Mm 

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,950 [Speaker 1]
... we do have learners from all around the world, as well as we'll be having learners from every domain, like let it be students or working professionals, like- 

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:31,950 [Speaker 0]
Mm 

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,280 [Speaker 1]
... the teachers, software developers, and everyone will be here in this, uh, program. 

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,219 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,120 [Speaker 1]
So, uh, it won't be possible for everyone to attend these live classes, right? 

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,620 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,560 [Speaker 1]
Like, some might... Even you, like, you'll be busy with your own stuff. 

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,840 [Speaker 0]
Indeed. 

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,880 [Speaker 1]
It won't be possible for you some days to attend these live classes, I believe. 

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,160 [Speaker 0]
Correct. 

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,780 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,940 [Speaker 1]
So that's the reason- 

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:54,950 [Speaker 0]
Okay 

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,880 [Speaker 1]
... the only sole reason, like, we are, why we have put it as a self-paced course. 

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,120 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,800 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,340 [Speaker 1]
So, uh, I'll do one... Just let me know, like, uh, can I understand your domain, like, so that I can guide you, like, which AI tools you can actually use? 

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,960 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, I'm part of, uh, financial planning and analysis. 

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,620 [Speaker 1]
Okay. You're part of- 

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,980 [Speaker 0]
Uh, into finance. Yeah. Sorry? 

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,700 [Speaker 1]
You're part of financial planning and analysis? 

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,560 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, FP&A. 

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:36,539 [Speaker 1]
Got it. So yeah, actually, there are a number of, uh, one thing. See, did you hear about this Data Rails, as well as Pigment, these kind of AI tools, did you hear about them? 

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,100 [Speaker 0]
Pigment, uh, heard. 

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,950 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, see Pigment- 

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,220 [Speaker 0]
Pigment I have heard. 

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:50,640 [Speaker 1]
Data, uh, Planful, Cube software. So these are a number of AI tools which are actually available for this financial planning and development, uh, analysis thing. 

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,920 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,940 [Speaker 1]
Just, uh, one second, Pawan. Can I just call you back in a couple of minutes? 

00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,560 [Speaker 0]
Mm. Yeah, yeah. 

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,400 [Speaker 1]
Just allow me one to two minutes, I'll call you back. 

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,340 [Speaker 0]
Okay.
