Yeah, yeah. What? 

00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:10,680 [Speaker 1]
I'm asking, you did not attended yesterday's masterclass or you attended but you did not completed it? What was the case? 

00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,119 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, I have connected the class, but in middle I have some network issue. I disconnected the class. 

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,100 [Speaker 1]
Okay, okay, okay. 

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,400 [Speaker 0]
So I want the details of it. 

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:31,120 [Speaker 1]
No problem. Definitely, Miss Haritha, I'll help you with that. Before I proceed deep into the program, can you please help me to understand, uh, like, what was your main intent, first of all, to join this, um, masterclass? 

00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,680 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Actually, I have completed my master's in twenty twenty-two, in June. 

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,700 [Speaker 1]
Uh, twenty twenty-two, you have completed your master's? 

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,060 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Uh, after that I am looking for the job. I'm planning to go for master's, but I have not decided it. 

00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,300 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,360 [Speaker 0]
You know, how to do course and how to join in job. 

00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:02,120 [Speaker 1]
Okay, okay. So basically, you are looking forward to the job. You did your grad-, uh, like, graduation in which domain? You are from BTech, engineering domain? 

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,620 [Speaker 0]
No, I have completed my degree, uh, Bachelor's of Computer Application. 

00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,900 [Speaker 1]
Bachelor's of Computer Application. Okay, and now you are looking forward to the job, right? 

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,640 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:24,119 [Speaker 1]
All right, amazing. And, like, before landing into a good job, I think you're looking for a proper upskillment, uh, wherein, like, because, uh, that will help you to land into a better job, if I'm not wrong, right? 

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, yes. 

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:39,100 [Speaker 1]
All right, all right, Haritha. Great, great to know that. So definitely, Haritha, like, as you told me, you are looking forward to an upskillment, and I believe you're looking forward to an upskillment into AI and prompt engineering, because these are the two most demanded skills in the market right now. 

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,240 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,780 [Speaker 1]
No, no, I'm asking you, you are looking forward to an upskillment into AI, right? 

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,760 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, yes. 

00:01:45,760 --> 00:02:03,120 [Speaker 1]
All right, all right. Okay. Yeah, see, there are a lot of people like you who actually are into the same situation and wants to make it, uh, to AI industry. Because you know, Haritha, this is completely an AI era, right? Wherein the things are being taken over by AI, irrespective of whatever domain I talk about. 

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,860 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:31,260 [Speaker 1]
Right? So how we can actually help you here with a proper upskillment into AI and prompt engineering, and how we can help you with a proper, uh, job assistance so that we can help you to land into a job. So for that, Haritha, like, we have a full-fledged program around AI, right? Uh, which is more kind of a on-the-job training program. Because after every module, you will be having one capstone projects to work on real-time basis, to get real-time hands-on experiences. All right? 

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,960 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:49,520 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Now, how it works, let me give you a clarity on that part. So as I told you, we have created a full-fledged program around AI, which is a self-paced learning program. So Haritha, self-paced learning program itself means which will be combination of both recorded classes and live classes. 

00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,060 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:02:50,060 --> 00:03:13,280 [Speaker 1]
Live classes we usually conduct on Saturdays and Sundays. That will be on weekends, either on Saturdays or Sundays, in the evening around seven o'clock, and the duration will be probably around two point five to three hours for that live class. And for remaining days, you will be getting a, uh, personalized access to your dashboard, wherein simply you can go through the self-paced learning recorded content as per your availability and flexibility. 

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,040 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,480 [Speaker 1]
All right? Now, Haritha, the entire access of the course will be given to you for one year, all right? Now, uh, as- 

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,500 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,780 [Speaker 1]
Sorry? 

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,740 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, uh, I can't hear. Uh, can you repeat please? 

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,920 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. I said, uh, the entire access of the course will be given to you for one year, twelve months. 

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,900 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Okay. 

00:03:31,900 --> 00:04:10,720 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Now, here at Freedom with AI, we have two memberships, Haritha. One is gold membership and one is silver membership. If I talk about our silver membership, which, uh, have twelve modules, and gold, uh, silver co- silver covers eight modules, right? Now, what exactly will be the structure of the program, what we do cover under this, and how we can actually help you to land into a job? So let me bifurcate the entire course curriculum for you into three parts, starting with the basics, Haritha. The first category that we do cover is the basics of foundation, foundations and basic fundamentals of artificial intelligence and, um, prompt engineering. 

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,329 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:52,780 [Speaker 1]
Now, under this AI, you will be completely getting, uh, knowledge about how this AI has been evolved. What is the scope of AI into different domain, whether let's say it's an IT industry, finance, marketing, whatever domain I talk about. You will be working on three hundred plus AI arsenal tools here. Now, again, three hundred plus tools, that means it will be mix of all the domains: IT, non-IT, technical, non-technical, marketing, finance, automation tools, digital marketing, data visualization. Each and every tool we will be, um, teaching you here. Based on that, second module completely covers the prompt engineering module, Haritha. Uh, are you aware about the prompt engineering, what exactly prompt engineering is? 

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,960 [Speaker 0]
No. 

00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:39,640 [Speaker 1]
All right. Let me give you a clarity on that part. See, prompt engineering is nothing, but it just twenty-five percent of your communication skills and seventy-five percent of your knowledge of using these AI tools. All right? Now, in that prompt engineering covers two aspect. One is non-technical and second one is technical side. Now, Haritha, for the people who are actually working on designing, development, deployment of these AI power tools, those are not... Uh, they are technical prompt engineers. But people like you, me, we are actually using these AI power tools, right? Like, we are the users of the- these tools, generative AI tools, so we are non-technical prompts engineers. So prompts are nothing but to give an input in order to get a desired output. Like you are working on ChatGPT, for example, right? 

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:39,680 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:05:39,680 --> 00:06:31,408 [Speaker 1]
Now... Yeah. Now, in order to, uh, get desired output out of ChatGPT, we have to give an input, right? So likewise, imagine if you're working as a working professional in some, in any of the company, if you're working on a project, when you need a proper context about prompt engineering, how to actually set a proper context, how to give inputs to a desired, uh, AI power tool to get a better input, uh, output out of it. So you'll be learning completely how to craft mega prompts-... Uh, what are the techniques of prompt engineering and each and everything, right? Then third is you will be working on ChatGPT model, which is OpenAI playground model, wherein again, you will be working on, uh, automation side. You will be learning how to streamline your workflows and lot of other things. The complete, uh, guide will be given to you on the ChatGPT part. 

00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:32,108 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:57,338 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So once you're, uh, done with these three, uh, modules, which are the basic modules, we will be helping you-- We'll focus on the second part of the program, wherein we do cover actually the modules like Excel Mastery, uh, with AI. Wherein how to integrate AI into Excel for the da-data visualization part, for data, uh, analysis part, reporting part, and all those stuff. How to use actually AI into data part. Second- 

00:06:57,338 --> 00:06:57,348 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:54,168 [Speaker 1]
-you will be working on, uh, monetization programs. Now, Haritha, if I talk about monetization here, we will be actually helping you with fifty such business plans, right? Wherein people like you, and there are a lot of working professionals and students who are actually looking forward to make a passive income out by monetizing these skills. So how you can do that? For that, we have a proper mentorship support here. Along with Avinash Marda, the team of mentors will be guiding you and will be giving you a proper roadmap. Like, for example, if you're very much interested to start your own AI digital marketing agency, or you want to start your AI automation agency, or a YouTube channel, or let's say, content creation, whatever is your area of interest. Just few examples I'm giving you. So how to work on that, uh, business model, uh, how to monetize that, how you can make passive income out of that. We will be guiding you at each and every step so that you can make a passive income out of it. All right? 

00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:54,708 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:07:54,708 --> 00:08:37,968 [Speaker 1]
Then the third part of the program covers the advanced level specializations, wherein, Haritha, uh, we will be actually helping you with four specializations. First is AI for developers, for people who want to make a switch into technical roles. So for them, we do have AI for developers, wherein we do cover Python programming, we cover LangChain models, we cover DSA models and everything. Those people will be working on designing deployment part. Second, if by any chance you have, uh, like, you want to move on to the non-technical side, let's say, then we have AI for UI/UX designers, wherein you will be getting hands-on experience on website designing part, application designing part, using AI power tools like Figma, Miro, and many more. 

00:08:39,408 --> 00:09:21,608 [Speaker 1]
Third covers the AI for digital marketers and business owners, wherein, uh, Haritha, people who have an entrepreneurial mindset to work on their own startup or to start their own, own freelancing work. So for them, we, uh, do have this entire digital marketing module. From basics to advanced level completely, we will be covering the digital marketing stuff like SEO optimization, how you can, uh, generate ad creatives using AI power tools, lead generation part, l- uh, LinkedIn mastery with AI and many more things. And then the last part of the program covers AI automation agency module, Haritha, wherein completely you will be working on automation side. Have you heard about AI chatbots? 

00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:22,728 [Speaker 2]
AI? 

00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,148 [Speaker 1]
AI chatbots and voice bots. 

00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:24,428 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:57,368 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So there you will be getting hands-on experience on working on AI bots. Uh, there actually, we will be teaching you how these AI bots work, how you can actually design these chatbots and voice bots, and how you can integrate those into your, uh, workflows to provide better customer services to the client. You might have noticed nowadays, every company, Amazon, Flipkart, Google, Swiggy, Zomato, whatever I talk abou- talk about, they have simply replaced the customer success department with these AI bots. Have you noticed that? 

00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:58,308 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:40,568 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So these AI-powered bots, because these can actually... These- because, see, humans can't be available twenty-four into seven, but these bots can be available twenty-four into seven, and they can provide better customer services to the clients. They can solve, uh, queries of the clients anytime, right? So it's actually important to work on these models so that we can improve our efficiency and productivity in our work, right? So this is how exactly the entire curriculum is curated. And this is a certification program, Haritha, wherein you will be getting ISO-certified certification from Freedom with AI, which is valid for both international and Indian market, because we are catering twenty-six countries across the globe. 

00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:41,548 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:10:41,548 --> 00:11:02,567 [Speaker 1]
And along with that, there will be cer- um, couple of other certifications, too, uh, after each and every module. And as I told you, after every module, like, there are twelve modules, so you will be having twelve capstone projects. You will be working on each and every module, and then after that, you will be getting one project, capstone projects to get a real-time hands-on experiences while working on those projects. 

00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:03,208 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:48,668 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. And y- yeah, as I told you, along with this monetization thing, we will be helping you with the job assistance, too. Like, whatever field, whether you're looking forward to a jobs in technical roles, non-technical, AI, whatever is your area of interest, based on your academic qualification, our, our mentors will be giving you a proper roadmap, and we will be helping you with the job assistance. Wherein team of mentors will be guiding you with your mock interviews, with your LinkedIn profile building, uh, resume building part and each and everything. And see, Haritha, whatever skills you will be learning and the capstone projects that you will be working on and the certifications which you will be getting, right? Once you will add that into your portfolio and resume, obviously, that will increase your chance to land into a better job with a good salary package. 

00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,408 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:11:49,408 --> 00:12:07,888 [Speaker 1]
Right? So this is how exactly, uh, we help our learners and the entire curriculum looks like. Before we, uh, like, discuss about the fee structure and the me- uh, the process of en- uh, enrollment process, I just wanted to understand whatever I have discussed with you so far, do you have any doubts and questions on this? 

00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,648 [Speaker 2]
Nothing, I know. 

00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:20,184 [Speaker 1]
All right. So, Haritha, what are your, uh, like, plans? Are you looking forward to technical roles? Are you planning, uh, like-... to go into non-technical side? 

00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:23,144 [Speaker 0]
No, actually, I'm planning for technical roles only. 

00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,804 [Speaker 1]
You're planning for technical roles. Okay. 

00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:24,894 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,244 [Speaker 1]
You have done BCA, right? 

00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:32,204 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Yes, I have done BCA and a Master's of Computer Applications, MCA. 

00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:54,723 [Speaker 1]
Okay, okay, got it. Great, great! Yeah. So definitely on, uh, you can make a swi- like you can apply for the technical roles, specifically into AI domain, like AI prompts engineer, AI generative engineer, or let's say, developers roles, or maybe, uh, data scientist role kind of things. Wherein simply you can leverage these AI skills that will actually help you to grow in your career. Right? 

00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:55,124 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:12:55,124 --> 00:13:44,223 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So, uh, Haritha, actually yesterday, like due to network issue, as you told me, you were unable to attend the class. So the amazing part of the program was the, uh, of the master class was that actually we opened forty slots yesterday, which were discounted memberships. So on the memberships, we were offering few discounts, but unfortunately all the forty slots were filled yesterday night. But still we do have five slots extra be- because we always keep buffer five slots, because, you know, how many people have doubts and then they were unable to do the enrollment that time. So we always keep five extra slots. Still, if you are looking forward to it, you can avail those offers. So if I talk about the gold membership, Haritha, under discounted membership, the entire course fees for one year will probably cost you triple nine, uh, triple nine seven, which is approximately ten thousand rupees. 

00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:44,624 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:13:44,624 --> 00:14:30,483 [Speaker 1]
For one year, and for silver it will be seven triple nine, which is eight thousand for one year. Now, what is the difference between gold and silver? Let me tell you that. See, in gold, Haritha, you'll be getting each and every module as, uh, whatever I have discussed with you, twelve modules we will be covering, along with all the four specializations. And on top of that, you will be getting some complimentary bonuses, wherein we will be giving you subscription of few tools, like Canva tool for entire one year, Nvideo.io tool, or you can select Nvideo or Microsoft 365 tool. But in silver we cover eight modules. We do not cover any specializations, which I told you, the four specializations, and we do not have a subscription of any tool in silver. In silver, we just cover the basic foundations and the monetization program. 

00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:33,864 [Speaker 0]
In gold, how many months it will take to complete the course? 

00:14:33,864 --> 00:15:09,823 [Speaker 1]
So, Haritha, it again depends on your pace of learning. As I told you, this is a self-paced learning program. We will be giving you the access for entire one year, but for a working professional, on an average, it takes five to six months down the line to complete the entire program. For example, Haritha, see, if you are spending one hour, one hour daily on your upskillment, obviously, easily you can cover the entire modules within five to six months, even, like, within four to five months down the line. But now again, it depends. If I'm spending thirty minutes of my time on daily basis, it will take seven to eight months for me, uh, to complete the modules, right? And regarding- 

00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:10,044 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:20,804 [Speaker 1]
Uh, if I talk about these live classes, we will be providing you for the entire one year, so that we can actually keep you updated with the latest trends and technologies which are coming up into the market. 

00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:21,524 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:41,684 [Speaker 1]
So probably on an average, uh, it takes five to six months for you. And yeah, parallelly, you do not have to wait for one month or six months or eight months down the line to land into a job. No. Parallelly, while you are upskilling, once you are done with your foundations, which will require probably one point five to two months of your time, you can simply start applying for the jobs. 

00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:42,444 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:15:42,444 --> 00:16:04,633 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So this is how exactly we have a dream job achievers package, uh, module in our, uh, entire curriculum, wherein we will be helping you with mock interviews, your resume building, your LinkedIn profile building. Because, you know, nowadays, HRs are also working on API. They are working on API models and AI power tools to shortlist the candidates' profile for the screening process, right? 

00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,444 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:10,644 [Speaker 1]
So yeah, we will be helping you with each and everything, because this is a comprehensive program. 

00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:11,983 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,824 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:20,003 [Speaker 0]
Okay, uh, can I decide and then I can pay within two days? Uh, is there time for that? 

00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:27,243 [Speaker 1]
Haritha, within two days though, won't be possible. Why? Because I told you, as these are the discounted memberships. Two days- 

00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:30,223 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Can I decide by tomorrow? 

00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:39,473 [Speaker 1]
Uh, not possible by any chance, till today, EOD. See, tomorrow also work for me, no problem, but as I told you, forty slots are filled, right? We have five slots. 

00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:39,503 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:16:39,503 --> 00:17:03,424 [Speaker 1]
If for example, if five slots are filled till today, EOD, right? Then even, uh, sorry to say, I won't be in a position to give you the discounted membership till tomorrow also. But if there are slots available till tomorrow, let's say, right? For example, obviously, I can help you with that. But yeah, uh, I can't, like, promise on that part. So, like, you need to discuss with your family, is it like that? 

00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,704 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, I have to talk with my father. 

00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:11,304 [Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, obviously. By the way, your father is into which profession, by any chance he's also into IT? 

00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:13,063 [Speaker 0]
No, no, he's business. 

00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,824 [Speaker 1]
He's into business? 

00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:18,284 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, this I have to ask for him, then I have to decide. 

00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:44,664 [Speaker 1]
Uh, huh, huh. No problem, Haritha. Let's do one thing, even I'll help you with the payment options so that you can discuss with him. See, one, we do have one-time payment option in place, and second, if by any chance your parents or you use a credit card, even, uh, like you can apply for no-cost EMIs option up to six months, wherein you can pay on monthly basis up to six months. So we do have EMI options also in place. And let's do one thing, Haritha. This is your WhatsApp number? 

00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,004 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, this is my number. 

00:17:46,004 --> 00:18:01,304 [Speaker 1]
I'm sharing all the details with you on your WhatsApp regarding the brochure, curriculum, whatever I have discussed with you regarding both the memberships, along with the fee structure. You take your time, discuss with your parents, not a problem. Uh, today is Sunday, I believe they might be available at home, right?
