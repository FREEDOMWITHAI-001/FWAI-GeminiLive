00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,280 [Speaker 0]
Hello, good evening. Am I speaking with Tanya Verma? 

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,200 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,180 [Speaker 0]
Hey, hi, Tanya. Sohani this side. I'm calling you from Freedom with AI. How are you? 

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,540 [Speaker 1]
I'm fine. How are you? 

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:18,660 [Speaker 0]
I'm doing good, thank you so much for asking. Actually, Tanya, this was a feedback call. Uh, yesterday you had a class with Avinash Mada, right? 

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,380 [Speaker 1]
Yes, yes. 

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,820 [Speaker 0]
Can you please share your feedback? Like, how was your experience? 

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:35,380 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, my experience was great, and, uh, I, I really enjoyed the, um, session. And, uh, I was looking towards the, uh- towards joining the, uh, session, but I won't be able to do it this month- 

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,730 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,560 [Speaker 1]
- because I'm having my university examination. 

00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,580 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,400 [Speaker 1]
And, uh, yeah. 

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,970 [Speaker 0]
Okay, this is okay. 

00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,940 [Speaker 1]
So give an offer in May, which I can join, because I'm super excited for the course. 

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,320 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, yeah. Actually, yeah, I can see here you, you were almost there for the entire session yesterday, right? 

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,500 [Speaker 1]
Yes, yes. 

00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,420 [Speaker 0]
That was only the reason we tried connecting with you, because, you know, yesterday also, we opened few of the discounted slots, right? 

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,900 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,150 [Speaker 0]
So we just wanted to check you if you are still interested and looking forward to. So by the way, Tanya- 

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,190 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,020 [Speaker 0]
- so yeah, you have your exam, that means you are a student as of now, you're not a working professional? 

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,960 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yes, yes. 

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,080 [Speaker 0]
All right. So by the way, what are you pursuing currently? 

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,780 [Speaker 1]
I'm pursuing, uh, uh, B, uh, integrated course, BSc plus BEd. 

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,540 [Speaker 0]
Uh, okay, integrated course, that is BSc plus BA? 

00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,979 [Speaker 1]
BEd. 

00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,290 [Speaker 0]
BEd. Okay, got it. 

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:28,300 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,610 [Speaker 0]
Got it. Okay. 

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:29,620 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,620 [Speaker 0]
Uh, so no problem, so you are having exam this month, is it like that? When your exams are starting? 

00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,480 [Speaker 1]
Uh, on twentieth of April. 

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,220 [Speaker 0]
Twenty-eighth or fifty? 

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,070 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,899 [Speaker 0]
And it will be? 

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,039 [Speaker 1]
Till the tenth of May. 

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,700 [Speaker 0]
Tenth of May. 

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:46,780 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:55,690 [Speaker 0]
Okay, got it. So, Tanya, first of all, uh, uh, before discussing about the exam part, I wanted to understand and get a little bit clarity, like, uh- 

00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:55,690 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:06,580 [Speaker 0]
... what is your main intent, first of all, to take up this masterclass and to go ahead with the program? Like, are you, are you looking for a proper structured upskillment into AI or something like that? 

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,000 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, actually, um, I want an second income source, so I was looking- 

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,540 [Speaker 0]
Okay 

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,859 [Speaker 1]
... uh, in the Instagram advertising. Through advertising, I got to know about this class and started. 

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,240 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,950 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,910 [Speaker 0]
All right. So main intent is to make a side hustle, a passive income source by monetizing AI skills. 

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,980 [Speaker 1]
Yes, yes. 

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:32,320 [Speaker 0]
All right, great. Definitely, uh, that's very much possible, and we can definitely help you out with that, because we do cover monetization modules here, uh, for our students- 

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,420 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,489 [Speaker 0]
... and professionals, which is specifically- 

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:34,510 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:43,650 [Speaker 0]
... for those only who are actually having an entrepreneurial mindset to start their own freelancing work, or let's say, YouTube channel or a content creation. Whatever is your- 

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:43,680 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:56,300 [Speaker 0]
... area of interest, we can actually help you to work on that business plan, and we can help you to monetize that to make a passive income. And for that, uh, Tanya, you will be getting a proper support from our team of mentors, along with Avinash Mada, too. 

00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,340 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,850 [Speaker 0]
So yeah- 

00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:56,850 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:11,120 [Speaker 0]
... you can have a complete structured curriculum. Coming to your point, as you have exams, I completely agree with you because we have, like, almost eighty percent of the learners who are working professional, and twenty percent of the learners, like you, who are, uh, students. 

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,180 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,620 [Speaker 0]
So yeah, they do have their exams and everything. I completely understand. But Tanya, first of all- 

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:17,670 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,820 [Speaker 0]
... uh, whenever you want, you can join the, uh, the program. That's not an issue. But what will be the two benefits of joining now? I just wanted to tell you that. First- 

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,080 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:44,280 [Speaker 0]
... see, if you're joining now at, uh, this month, so definitely you attended a masterclass and you were part of it. Wherein, after, uh, seeing your attendance in the masterclass, obviously we still have five buffer slots, wherein you can still avail those discounted membership slots. So you will be getting discounts- 

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,290 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,000 [Speaker 0]
... on the membership. That is first thing. But again- 

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,010 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:03:47,010 --> 00:04:02,970 [Speaker 0]
... let's keep that aside if finance is not the problem. Second, see, again, this is a self-paced learning program. If you still have your exam, these, this program is not going to affect your exam by any, uh, in any which ways. Because, see, you, we will be only- 

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:02,970 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:10,640 [Speaker 0]
... conducting live cla... uh, this is a self-paced learning, which means, Tanya, you will be having live classes and recorded classes, both. 

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:10,790 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,540 [Speaker 0]
So live class, we only conduct on weekends, either on Saturdays or Sunday, once in a week, right? That will be in the evening- 

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:17,589 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,959 [Speaker 0]
- around seven o'clock. 

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,000 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,300 [Speaker 0]
And remaining days, you will be getting access to your personalized dashboard, which you can actually access any time in a day, according to your flexibility and availability. 

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,820 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:41,539 [Speaker 0]
And you just have to invest hardly thirty to sixty minutes of your time on daily basis, whenever you are available. Now, example: you have one, uh, like, exam this month, entire month, right? You won't be able to invest- 

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:41,670 [Speaker 1]
Right 

00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:50,500 [Speaker 0]
... your time on self-paced learning module. That's completely okay, because the entire access for the course will be with you for one year. That is the reason. 

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:50,700 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,600 [Speaker 0]
You can simply- 

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,670 [Speaker 1]
Right 

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:57,300 [Speaker 0]
... stop your course, and you can again restart. Coming to the live classes only, you have to attend. But let's say- 

00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,310 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,120 [Speaker 0]
... if you are also missing out on any of the live classes due to exams, for example- 

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,270 [Speaker 1]
Uh 

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:11,340 [Speaker 0]
... then also, Tanya, we will be helping you with the recorded, uh, recordings of the same live classes on your dashboard, which you can use for your future reference. 

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,920 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,830 [Speaker 0]
So, uh, yeah, because, see, all the students are working in the similar way, because obviously they also have exams- 

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,940 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,340 [Speaker 0]
... and all those things. So nobody can- 

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:19,450 [Speaker 1]
Right 

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:27,520 [Speaker 0]
... leave their jobs, nobody can leave their academic, uh, things and can do upskillment. Not possible, right? Parallelly, how you can manage that- 

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,530 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:34,760 [Speaker 0]
... that is the reason why we have curated such kind of a program. Uh, so yeah, th- uh, this is completely flexible. Now, coming to- 

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:34,780 [Speaker 1]
Mm 

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:45,680 [Speaker 0]
... second part, if you want to join next month, that's fine for us, not an issue. But again, the fee structure will not remain same. Because, see, you know, Tanya, discounts are only for limited period of time. 

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:45,820 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:05:45,820 --> 00:06:34,416 [Speaker 0]
Actually, the fee structure then will, uh, sh- uh, will be the standard fee structure next month, which will be probably around sixteen thousand six hundred for Gold and eleven thousand eight hundred for Silver. Uh, wherein right now it's triple nine seven for Gold and seven triple nine for Silver.... Mm-hmm. So yeah, these are the two benefits, but again, like, then the decision will be yours. Now, third thing, if you still you are interested very much, and you want to actually do the onboarding process and want to take the admission, you can, uh, complete the process, and we can hold on your seat, and we can help you with the onboarding process once your exams are done. And we can help you to accommodate with the new batch within the same fee structure, like the same discounts. Even the, uh-- we can do that. So these three are the alternative options wherein I can help you out with. 

00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,455 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:36,296 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,895 [Speaker 1]
Um, 

00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:42,736 [Speaker 1]
can you give me time, a little bit, so that I can decide and tell you? 

00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:51,945 [Speaker 0]
Uh-huh. Time like, uh, l-- Okay, no problem, Tanya. I can't-- I won't be able to give you like, uh, weeks of time, but again, you can take time till tomorrow- 

00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:51,945 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,816 [Speaker 0]
- because we are just left with five slots. Right? 

00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:55,335 [Speaker 1]
Okay, okay. 

00:06:55,335 --> 00:07:00,535 [Speaker 0]
Do you have idea about the entire curriculum, Tanya, what exactly we are going to cover here? 

00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:02,895 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, I had an idea a little bit- 

00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:03,186 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:09,275 [Speaker 1]
-about the mastercla- class. Not, uh, the whole idea, but I got an approach. 

00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,145 [Speaker 0]
All right. 

00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:10,176 [Speaker 1]
When I... Yeah. 

00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:20,546 [Speaker 0]
So, yeah, if you want, I can actually share the insights with you right now. It will hardly take two minutes of your time, wherein I'll give you the complete picture, what exactly the program is, and how we can- 

00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:20,546 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:24,176 [Speaker 0]
-actually help you to make a passive income source. 

00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:24,955 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:25,096 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,816 [Speaker 1]
You can share it with me. 

00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:26,854 [Speaker 0]
Uh- 

00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,756 [Speaker 1]
I will tell you my decision. 

00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:36,895 [Speaker 0]
Do you want... Okay, so do you want me to share the documents or like we, uh, do you want me to, like, uh, tell you all the things right now verbally? 

00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:39,395 [Speaker 1]
Uh, you can share it with me. Fine. 

00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,356 [Speaker 0]
Okay, no problem. So this is your WhatsApp number? 

00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:43,496 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:07:43,496 --> 00:08:02,476 [Speaker 0]
All right. So, Tanya, I'll help you with the entire document, uh, and the curriculum PDF, plus fee structure for both Silver and Gold membership. So you can check the details, and, yeah, whatever we do cover in Gold, we cover twelve modules, and along with that, you will be having twelve capstone projects to get real-time hands-on experiences. And also, you will be getting- 

00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:02,926 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:19,936 [Speaker 0]
-complimentary bonuses, wherein we will be giving you subscription of few tools for entire one year, which is Canva subscription, which you can simply use for your passive income source, like, um, uh, that can-- you can use for post creation, video creation, marketing and content generation. Easily, that can be- 

00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:20,066 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:43,576 [Speaker 0]
-via that tool. Second is invideo.io tool, which you can use for generating high-level advanced AI video and that is an video editing tool. And third is a Microsoft 365. Wherein if I talk about Silver, Tanya, in Silver, we do not cover any specializations and we do not give any subscription. Yeah, we just cover the foundations and the monetization, uh, things in Silver membership. 

00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:45,016 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:55,435 [Speaker 0]
Now, once you will check the curriculum, you'll be getting the insights, what exactly we will be covering. So see, uh, let me just quickly walk you through the entire curriculum once. 

00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,656 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:08:56,656 --> 00:09:03,376 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. So, Tanya, initially, we will be starting with your foundations on fundamentals of AI and prompts engineering. 

00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,216 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:16,976 [Speaker 0]
Wherein actually you will be working on three hundred plus AI arsenal tools. Now, if I talk about three hundred plus tools, that will be mix of all the domains: IT, non-IT, finance, marketing, sales, whatever we talk about. 

00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:17,276 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:30,076 [Speaker 0]
Second, you will be working on prompt engineering module. Now, in prompt engineering, Tanya, you will be learning how to craft mega prompts. Because you know, Tanya, when you are even working on ChatGPT or any AI tool, you need to give inputs. 

00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:30,695 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,336 [Speaker 0]
So those inputs are nothing but prompts. Now, in prompt engineering- 

00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:34,346 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:38,216 [Speaker 0]
... you need to understand the techniques of prompting. You need to understand- 

00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:38,226 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:52,896 [Speaker 0]
... how to craft mega prompts in order to get a desired output out of it. So you'll be working on those modules. Third, you will be working on ChatGPT model completely, wherein you will be l-learning about automation part, streamlining your workflows and everything. 

00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:53,415 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:09:53,415 --> 00:10:07,616 [Speaker 0]
Fourth, then second part of the program covers the, uh, d- Excel mastery with AI, wherein how you can integrate AI into data part, data visualization, data reporting, Excel mastery and everything, using AI-powered tools. 

00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:07,636 [Speaker 1]

And last part of the program covers AI automation agency module, wherein, Tanya, you will be completely working on the automation side, like how to design AI bots and, uh- 

00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:46,746 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:49,476 [Speaker 0]
... web bots. Have you heard about AI bots? 

00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,256 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,366 [Speaker 0]

00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:51,915 [Speaker 1]
Little bit, yeah. 

00:11:51,915 --> 00:12:06,561 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. You know, right, uh, we are using applications like Swiggy, Zomato, Flipkart, Amazon. Nowadays, every company has replaced the customer support department with AI bots. If you have any query, you are simply giving input, uh, that... prompt to, into that AI chatbot- 

00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,301 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:14,521 [Speaker 0]
-and, uh, the, the same moment you are get, uh, getting the response. So basically, that is a bot who is talking to you. There is no person, right? 

00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:14,531 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:18,202 [Speaker 0]
That is a bot, and that is working on AI ML model.

Yeah. 

00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:26,771 [Speaker 0]
So you'll be working how to design those bots, how to integrate those into your workflows, and how you can provide better services to your clients. For example, you started with- 

00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:26,862 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:31,832 [Speaker 0]
-a digital marketing service. Now, you can't be available twenty-four into seven for your clients. But- 

00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:32,051 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:42,992 [Speaker 0]
... that work can be done by bots once you, once you are integrating that bot into your services. So that bot will be easily helping you to solve your customer queries on a real-time basis. 

00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:43,411 [Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah. 

00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:48,612 [Speaker 0]

00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:08,551 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:19,111 [Speaker 0]

Hmm 

00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:46,651 [Speaker 0]
... pay extra, right? If you're getting an opportunity just for, uh, the, like, one month of time, why you want to pay extra? And simply, this is a flexible program wherein you can hold on and you can again restart, right? 

00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:46,670 [Speaker 2]
